# Pick a Random Number

# Ask User For Number
# Add count + 1
# If the guess is less than number, say "Too Low"
# If the guess is more than the number, say "Too high"
# If you guess the number, stop asking for number and say "You win"

# If the total count of all guesses is > than 5 times wrong, say "You Lose"
